## Project Description

- My web-based app is called Rapid Fire Random Knowledge. This app will pit users against a computer that will generate a preset list of questions at random over the course of three levels with each level increasing in difficulty. The difficulty of the levels will be determined by the amount of time the user has to answer each question in the level. However, given its namesake, the list of questions will be utterly random; and will range in any topic, from Bollywood movies to Astrophysics.

- In the future, I would like to add two additional levels and add the option to play against a friend.
